# Purpose of the analysis
With an idea about Pandas and Matplotlib, the purpose of the assignemnt was to use these skills to create a dataframe to aid the ride-sharing analysis across the city types - Urban, Suburban and Rural. A visual/graphical representation to show the fares for each city type was also created to better view the analysis.

# Results
As per the analysis, the dataframe as shown in the below image, clearly shows that the correlation between the demand and supplu across the city types. For a rural city, there are less drivers compared to either suburban or orban. But the average fare per ride and driver is more for rural. This could be explained to the fact that drivers in rural areas are more indemand and hence the avg fare is higher. On the other hand, suburban cities, have more drivers compared to the rural cities but the average fare is lesser. While it comes to the Urban cities, the demand is high as seen by the rides, hence there are more drivers, due to which the average fare is much lesser.

In the graph, we are analysing the trends for the last 5 months. As seen in the multiple line graph, the fares in the rural cities are almost consistent across the months, however, there seems to be a slight increase in late february and even higher increase in the month of April. The fares for suburban cities seem to be a lot more volatile  compared to other types. While there is an increase in late february there is a considerable dip in fares after earlu April. For Urban cities, fares seem to be increasing in late Februaury and early March but dips suddenly in mid March before regaining some stability thereon.

# Summary
Going by the analysis, the CEO can look into some of these recomemndations to address the disparities in the city types. 
1. Increase the riders in rural areas, which may help address the demand of the drivers there. EVen though comparitively, rural cities are less polulated, the difference between the average fare per ride and the drivers is quite considerable, hence increasing the number of rides may help achieving more profits. 
2. Dips in fare prices in certain months - Especialy in urban cities, there seems to be sudden decreases in fare prices in feb and march. Maybe some promotion can be undertaken during this period to increase rides. 
3. Drivers on demand - To have more consistency in the fares across the months and periods, the CEO can influence driver count as per the demand. Even the pricing can be increased and decreased based on the demand during a certain period. Bringing such adaptability to the price or driver counts may provide a consistent profits across the time periods.
